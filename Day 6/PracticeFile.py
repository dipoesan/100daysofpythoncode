# All about functions
# They end with a parentheses "()"
# Examples are "print()", "len()"
# We can also define/create a function of our own
# This is done by using "def" keyword then  name of our function
# Then we add all instructions/lines of code we wany to execute
# We can then call the function later b y specifying the name of the function and adding the parentheses
